Hello there. I'm Markus Peltola, a lifelong tech enthusiast and self-proclaimed nerd with a passion for building and optimizing
systems. Currently, I work as an Development Team Lead at <a href="https://www.rantalainen.fi/en/">Rantalainen</a>, where I help
our internal and external clients to automate their work flows and integrate systems to one another.

Outside of work, I'm equally fascinated by the business side of things and keep a close eye on finance news to stay informed about
the ever-changing world of economics. This blend of tech and business curiosity shapes how I approach challenges both
professionally and personally.

When I'm not buried in code or exploring the latest tech trends, I enjoy the slower pace of life. Reading is my go-to way to
unwind and focus in today's fast-paced world. Our lovely little family contains a delightful German Spitz, who brings joy and
mischief in equal measure. The dog loves walks in the snowy forest above anything else.

In my free time, you'll often find me at the gym, improving my fitness, or immersed in music — my tastes are as eclectic as they
come, from Japanese Garage Rock from the 00's to the latest Italian pop music. Occasionally, I even pick up a guitar to strum out
some tunes of my own.

I use vim by the way ;)
